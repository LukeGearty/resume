    <h1>Graphic Design</h1>
    <h2>My Design Journey</h2>
    <p>I have a degree in Communication Arts from NYIT, and I was introduced to design software there - photoshop and after effects primarily.</p>
    <p>It wasn't until the Covid-19 pandemic however, when I began to study design in earnest. I learned about typography, color theory, layouts, and more. I worked for a few local businesses, and I lended my skills to a non-profit.</p>
    <p>The aspect of design that I really love is photo manipulation. I loved making collages as a kid, and photo manipulation is just an extreme version of that.</p>
