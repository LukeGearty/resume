    <h1>Personal Trainer</h1>
    <p>Always an enthusiast of working out, in December of 2019 I took an ACE Personal Trainer certification exam and passed. One month later, I was working in a corporate gym.</p>
    <p>I was charged with prospecting clients, retaining current clients, and assisting with gym members as needed.</p>
    <p>A few months after starting my career, the Covid-19 pandemic forced gyms around the country to close. When they reopened, I returned to work and began finding clients in earnest.</p>
    <p>Over the course of my career, I had roughly 10 regular clients, including three that I had for over a year.</p>
